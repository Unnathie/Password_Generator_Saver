# 🔑 Password Generator & Saver  
A sleek little Tkinter-powered password generator that not only creates strong passwords but also saves them (because let’s be real—you won’t remember them anyway).  

## 🎥 Demo

Here’s how the Password Generator looks in action:

## ✨ Features
- 🎲 **Randomized Strong Passwords**  
  Letters, numbers, and symbols all shuffled into beautiful chaos.  

- 📋 **Auto-Copy to Clipboard**  
  Because Ctrl+C is too mainstream—your password is ready to paste instantly.  

- 📝 **Save Credentials**  
  Stores your website, username/email, and generated password in a tidy `passwordsaver.txt` file.  

- 🎨 **Custom UI Theme**  
  Dark background with soft blue accents—minimalist yet easy on the eyes.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pyperclip
3. Place an image named **`passwordcreator.png`** in the same folder. (Your app’s logo!)  
4. Run:  
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
pyperclip
